        DAY FOR PARTICULATES FROM 400 PM WEDNESDAY UNTIL 400 PM\nTHURSDAY...\nThe
        Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has\nissued the following...\nWHAT...Action
        Day for Particulates.\nWHERE...Douglas, Jefferson, Denver, western Arapahoe,
        western\nAdams, Broomfield, Boulder, Larimer, and Weld Counties\nWHEN...400
        PM Wednesday September 30 to 400 PM Thursday October 01\nIMPACTS...Action
        Day for Particulates is now in effect for the\nseven-county Denver-Boulder
        metropolitan area. Requests to limit\ndriving of non- ZEV vehicles (i.e.,
        gas or diesel) are now in\neffect until at least 4 PM Thursday, October 1,
        2020.  Smoke from\nseveral local wildfires is affecting air quality, resulting
        in\nFine Particulate concentrations in the Unhealthy for Sensitive\nGroups
        category in locations throughout the Colorado Front Range\nregion. Daytime
        mixing of the atmosphere will generally allow\nsmoke to lift and surface concentrations
        to decrease, however\nperiods of moderate to heavy smoke are expected to return
        during\novernight and early morning hours on Wednesday and Thursday. For\nareas
        included in this advisory that are not expected to exceed\nthe Unhealthy for
        Sensitive Groups (USG) air quality designation,\nwe request that activities,
        such as driving non-ZEV vehicles\n(i.e., gas or diesel), be reduced to lessen
        the impacts on\nneighboring air quality. Additional air pollution in this
        region\nmay directly worsen air quality or contribute to precursors which\nmay
        also adversely affect air quality.  For Colorado air quality\nconditions,
        forecasts and advisories, visit:\nhttps://www.colorado.gov/airquality/colorado_summary.aspx\nHEALTH
        INFORMATION...If smoke is thick or becomes thick in your\nneighborhood you
        may want to remain indoors. This is especially\ntrue for those with heart
        disease, respiratory illnesses, the very\nyoung, and the elderly. Consider
        limiting outdoor activity when\nmoderate to heavy smoke is present. Consider
        relocating\ntemporarily if smoke is present indoors and is making you ill.
        If\nvisibility is less than 5 miles in smoke in your neighborhood,\nsmoke
        has reached levels that are unhealthy."}]}'
